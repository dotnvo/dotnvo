### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ . I'll add more to this later.



- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on several different projects:
  - Automating tasks in M365
  - Automating reporting into tableau dashboards from m365
  - Various home automation tasks via IOT products
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Powershell and branching out slowly to other languages.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything! I love to help and learn!
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with more web dev stuff. I'm thinking about diving into PHP. I know some basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript, but I spend most of that time Googling to figure things out :)
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Powershell, financing, gaming, music, home improvement, DIY projects, and anything else you can think of!
